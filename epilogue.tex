\section{peter m.j. gross: they don't come better}
\lettrine[lines=3]{\color{BrickRed}I}{\enspace} want to thank \textit{Peter M.J. Gross} for his fantastic work editing this
edition. To give the credit he deserves will sound trite and woefully inadequate
at the same time. Peter is a man who's thoroughness, understanding, and
relentless pursuit of quality are second to none.

By the way, Peter doesn't know I'm writing this \textit{thanks} here so if there are any
errors or awkward grammar the fault is fully my own.

\noindent Thank you, Peter.


\section{coming up}
The next issue of \textit{Discoverer's Digest} covers the results of this year's
\textsc{IF Comp} results and possibly an interview from one or two of the authors.

Covered also will be more mapping techniques and a guide for
\textsc{gps}\textendash enabled \textsc{if}.

See you next time! \\ \\

\noindent Fair Winds, \\ \\
